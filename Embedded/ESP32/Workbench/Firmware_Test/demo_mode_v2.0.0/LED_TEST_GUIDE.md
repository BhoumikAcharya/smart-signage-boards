# LED Chase Test Guide — `led_test_2.ino`

> Companion to [`../TESTING_GUIDE.md`](../TESTING_GUIDE.md). That guide proves the **board** works.
> This one is for tuning the **arrow chase animation** on the bench — direction, arrow width,
> reset behaviour, and speed.
>
> **Implementing the animation in the production firmware?** Read
> [`CHASE_ANIMATION_SPEC.md`](./CHASE_ANIMATION_SPEC.md) instead — it is the implementation contract
> and is self-contained. This document is a bench procedure, not a spec.

## 1. What this sketch does

It boots **straight into the `D` demo loop** from `Firmware_Test.ino` — no key press needed — and
repeats it forever:

```
LEFT chase 10 s  →  RIGHT chase 10 s  →  ALL OFF 3 s  →  (repeat)
```

Only the active side animates; the other side is held dark.

**On power-on it runs Chase 2 with a 2-LED arrow at a 250 ms step delay** — the chosen signage
animation. Plug the board in and that is what plays, with no Serial input at all. Everything else
below is available over Serial for comparison, and none of it persists across a reset.

Three things are different from `Firmware_Test.ino`:

| | `Firmware_Test.ino` | `led_test_2.ino` |
|---|---|---|
| **Direction** | `A0 → A4`, `B0 → B4` | **`A4 → A0`, `B4 → B0`** |
| **Frames** | 5 hard-coded constants | generated at runtime from the LED count |
| **Blocking?** | demo blocks until you press a key | **non-blocking** — you can change settings while it runs |

There are **no sensor or voltage commands here**. Use `Firmware_Test.ino` for those.

## 2. How the animation is built

Each strip has 5 channels (`0`–`4`). The arrow **head** walks from channel 4 down to channel 0, with
the body trailing behind it. Taking a 3-LED arrow as the illustration (Chase 1, which keeps every
frame):

| Frame | Channels lit | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| 0 | `A4, A3, A2` | |
| 1 | `A3, A2, A1` | |
| 2 | `A2, A1, A0` | end of the strip |
| 3 | `A1, A0, A4` | **wrap** — arrow breaks across the seam |
| 4 | `A0, A4, A3` | **wrap** |

Frames 3 and 4 are the ones where the arrow visually "breaks apart" and stops reading as an arrow.
That's exactly what **Chase 2** — the boot default — removes.

### The three chase modes

- **Chase 1 (`c 1`)** — plays all 5 frames including the wrap. Continuous motion, but the
  arrow splits across the seam twice per cycle.
- **Chase 2 (`c 2`, the boot default)** — stops after the last frame that fits inside the strip and
  **restarts at the top**. The arrow always reads cleanly 4→0, at the cost of a visible jump back to
  the top. At the default **2-LED** width that's a 4-frame cycle:

| Frame | Channels lit |
|-------|--------------|
| 0 | `A4, A3` |
| 1 | `A3, A2` |
| 2 | `A2, A1` |
| 3 | `A1, A0` → restart |

  Two adjacent LEDs sliding 4→0, then jumping back. At a 3-LED width it's `A4,A3,A2` → `A3,A2,A1` →
  `A2,A1,A0`, a 3-frame cycle.

- **Chase 3 (`c 3`)** — **spaced trail.** Two dots sit **2 channels apart** instead of touching, and
  the trailing dot is simply **not lit until it lands on the strip**. Head still walks 4→0, no wrap,
  resets after the head reaches `A0`:

| Frame | Channels lit |
|-------|--------------|
| 0 | `A4` |
| 1 | `A3` |
| 2 | `A2, A4` |
| 3 | `A1, A3` |
| 4 | `A0, A2` → restart |

  So it starts as a single dot walking in from the far end, and once it's two channels deep a second
  dot appears behind it. Reads as a dashed arrow rather than a solid bar.

  **Chase 3 is capped at 2 dots.** A third dot would land on `A4` in the last frame (`A0, A2, A4`),
  re-lighting the far end of the strip just as the arrow finishes — that reads as a flash, not as
  motion, so it's excluded. The LED count still works *downward*: `1` gives a single dot walking 4→0
  (identical to Chase 2 at 1 LED), while `2`, `3`, `4` and `5` all give the pair above. For a wider
  solid arrow use Chase 1 or Chase 2. Typing `c 3` prints the live frame table so you can see
  exactly what you'll get.

Frame count per cycle:

| Arrow LEDs | Chase 1 | Chase 2 | Chase 3 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 | 5 | 5 (identical — a single LED never wraps) | 5 (single dot) |
| **2** | 5 | **4** ← default | 5 |
| 3 | 5 | 3 | 5 (capped to 2 dots) |
| 4 | 5 | 2 | 5 (capped to 2 dots) |
| 5 | 5 | 1 (all channels on, static) | 5 (capped to 2 dots) |

> Because Chase 2 has fewer frames, one full cycle takes **less time** at the same step delay. Chase
> 1 and Chase 3 are always 5 × delay; Chase 2 shrinks as the arrow gets wider. Expect Chase 2 to look
> faster even though the per-step speed is unchanged.
>
> At the boot default — **Chase 2, 2 LEDs, 250 ms** — one sweep is 4 × 250 ms = **exactly 1 s**, so a
> 10-second side fits 10 whole sweeps and ends on a frame boundary rather than mid-arrow.

## 3. Serial command reference

Serial Monitor at **115200 baud**, line ending set to **Newline** (or Both NL & CR). Commands are
**line-based** — type the command, then press **Enter**.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `1` … `5` | Set the number of LEDs in the arrow (bare number shortcut) |
| `n 2` | Same thing, explicit form |
| `c 1` | **Chase 1** — arrow wraps around the strip |
| `c 2` | **Chase 2** — arrow resets at the end of the strip (**boot default**) |
| `c 3` | **Chase 3** — spaced trail, 2 dots 2 channels apart, resets after `A0` |
| `d 250` | Set the step delay to 250 ms (accepts **5–5000**) |
| `p` | Pause / resume the demo (pausing turns all LEDs off) |
| `?` | Print current settings **and the full frame table** |
| `h` | Reprint the menu |

**Power-on defaults:** **Chase 2, 2 LEDs, 250 ms step delay.** These are **not** saved across a
reset — every power cycle comes back to Chase 2 / 2 LEDs / 250 ms, as intended.

> Unlike Chase 3 (which caps at 2 dots regardless), Chase 2 uses the LED count directly — it sets
> both the **arrow width** and the **frame count**, so changing it also changes how long one sweep
> takes. See the table in §2.

Changing any setting **restarts the animation from frame 0** so the new geometry is visible
immediately instead of appearing mid-sweep. The 10 s / 10 s / 3 s phase timing keeps running
underneath — a setting change does not restart the demo phases.

The `?` output shows the live frame table with bits printed **4→0** (`A4 A3 A2 A1 A0`), so
`[11000]` means A4 and A3 are lit:

```
>> LEDs:2  Mode:2 (reset at end)  Delay:250 ms  Frames:4  running
   frames: [11000] [01100] [00110] [00011]
   (bit order shown is 4..0, i.e. A4 A3 A2 A1 A0)
```

## 4. Step-by-step bench procedure

### Step 0 — Flash and connect
1. Open `led_test_2/led_test_2.ino`, select your ESP32 board + port, upload.
2. Open Serial Monitor @ **115200 baud**, line ending **Newline**.
3. Confirm `Probing MCP23017 @0x20 on SDA=4/SCL=13 ... OK`. If it says `NOT FOUND!` the sketch
   halts — fix the I2C wiring first (see [`../TESTING_GUIDE.md`](../TESTING_GUIDE.md) §4 Step 1).
4. Confirm the boot status line reads **`LEDs:2  Mode:2 (reset at end)  Delay:250 ms  Frames:4`**
   and that the animation starts on its own.

### Step 1 — Confirm the reversed direction
1. Watch the LEFT phase. The arrow must move **from A4 towards A0** — i.e. from the far end of the
   strip back towards channel 0. This is the **opposite** of `Firmware_Test.ino`.
2. If it runs A0→A4 instead, your **strip is wired in reverse order** relative to the MCP23017
   port — note which physical strip corresponds to which channel number.
3. Confirm the RIGHT phase does the same thing on Port B (`B4 → B0`).

### Step 2 — Confirm the phase timing
1. Time one full cycle: LEFT should hold for ~10 s, RIGHT for ~10 s, then **everything dark for
   3 s**.
2. During LEFT, the RHS strips must be **completely off** (and vice versa). Any bleed-through means
   a MOSFET is stuck on — go back to `Firmware_Test.ino` and test that channel with `0`–`9`.

### Step 3 — Confirm the default animation (Chase 2, 2 LEDs)
1. Straight out of boot you should see **two adjacent LEDs** sliding down the strip: `A4`+`A3` →
   `A3`+`A2` → `A2`+`A1` → `A1`+`A0`, then **jumping back to the top**.
2. Confirm the two LEDs are **touching** — there must be no dark channel between them (a gap means
   you're in Chase 3, not Chase 2).
3. Confirm the arrow **never splits across the ends** of the strip — you should never see `A0` lit
   together with `A4`. That would mean Chase 1.
4. Confirm the step rate looks like **250 ms** — a full 4-frame sweep takes **exactly 1 second**, so
   you should count 10 clean sweeps per 10-second side, with the side ending on a whole sweep.

### Step 4 — Compare against the other chase modes
1. Type `c 1` + Enter. Same 2-LED arrow, but now it **wraps** — watch for the frame where `A0` and
   `A4` are lit together and the arrow breaks across the seam.
2. Type `c 3` + Enter. The two dots separate to **2 channels apart**: `A4` → `A3` → `A2`+`A4` →
   `A1`+`A3` → `A0`+`A2`, then restart.
3. Type `c 2` + Enter to return to the default.
4. Decide which reads better on the real signage board at viewing distance. That's the whole point
   of this sketch.

### Step 5 — Arrow width
1. Type `3` + Enter. In Chase 2 the arrow widens to **3 LEDs** and the cycle drops to **3 frames**,
   so one sweep gets shorter (3 × 250 ms) even though the step rate is unchanged.
2. Type `1` + Enter. A **single LED** should walk 4→3→2→1→0 and repeat.
3. Type `4`, then `5`. At 5 the whole strip is lit — an arrow as wide as the strip has nowhere to
   move in Chase 2 (1 frame), and just rotates in Chase 1.
4. Type `2` to return to the default. Type `?` to confirm the frame table matches what you see.
5. Try an out-of-range value like `7` — it should reject with `!! LED count must be 1-5` and leave
   the animation untouched.
6. Switch to `c 3` and type `3` — it should accept the value but print the **2-dot cap note**, and
   the animation should stay at two dots. Then `c 2` and `2` to get back to the default.

### Step 6 — Speed
1. Type `d 400` + Enter — the chase should visibly slow down from the 250 ms default.
2. Type `d 60` — noticeably faster.
3. Sweep for the speed that looks right on the physical board, then `d 250` to return to the
   default. Typical range to try: **80–350 ms**.
4. Try `d 2` — it should reject with `!! Delay must be 5-5000 ms`.

> **Note:** at very short delays you're limited by the I2C write rate to the MCP23017. If the
> animation stops getting faster below ~20 ms, that's the bus, not the code.

### Step 7 — Record the winning combination
The current defaults are **Chase 2, 2 LEDs, 250 ms**. If bench testing lands somewhere else, write
down what you settled on:

- **Chase mode:** ______ (1 = wrap, 2 = reset, 3 = spaced trail)
- **Arrow LEDs:** ______ (drives width *and* frame count in modes 1 and 2; capped at 2 in mode 3)
- **Step delay:** ______ ms

To change the power-on defaults, edit the constants near the top of `led_test_2.ino`:

```cpp
const int           DEFAULT_LEDS  = 2;   // arrow is 2 LEDs wide
const int           DEFAULT_MODE  = 2;   // reset at end (no wrap)
const unsigned long DEFAULT_DELAY = 250; // ms per animation step
```

These same three values are what should eventually be carried into the production firmware's
animation code.

## 5. Pass criteria

- [ ] MCP23017 detected `OK` on SDA=4 / SCL=13.
- [ ] Demo starts on its own at power-on — no key press required — in **Chase 2 / 2 LEDs / 250 ms**.
- [ ] Chase runs **A4→A0** on the LEFT phase and **B4→B0** on the RIGHT phase.
- [ ] Phase timing is 10 s / 10 s / 3 s, with the idle side fully dark.
- [ ] The default `c 2` runs `A4,A3` → `A3,A2` → `A2,A1` → `A1,A0` and then restarts at the top, with
      the two LEDs **touching** and **never** `A0` and `A4` lit together.
- [ ] One sweep takes ~1 s, so a 10-second side shows ~10 whole sweeps.
- [ ] `c 1` / `c 3` still switch to the other modes, and `c 2` returns to the default.
- [ ] Typing `1`–`5` changes the arrow width live, without stopping the demo.
- [ ] `d <ms>` changes the speed live.
- [ ] After a power cycle, the sketch comes back at **Chase 2 / 2 LEDs / 250 ms**.

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Compile fails with `redefinition of 'void setup()'` | A copy of the sketch ended up next to `Firmware_Test.ino` — see §0. |
| Commands do nothing | Serial Monitor line ending is set to **No line ending**. Set it to **Newline**. |
| `!! Unknown command 'x'` on every input | Same as above, or you typed the argument without the letter (e.g. `200` instead of `d 200` — a bare number is read as an LED count). |
| Arrow runs 0→4 instead of 4→0 | Strip is physically wired in reverse relative to the MCP port. Confirm channel-to-strip mapping with `Firmware_Test.ino` keys `0`–`9`. |
| Animation stutters | Step delay is near the I2C write floor — raise it above ~20 ms. |
| One channel never lights during the chase | Not an animation bug. Test that MOSFET individually in `Firmware_Test.ino`. |
