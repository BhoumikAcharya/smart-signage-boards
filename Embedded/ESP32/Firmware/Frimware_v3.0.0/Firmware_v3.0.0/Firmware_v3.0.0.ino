 * 
 * These are the values for the test PCB_1 (Marked with maskign tape)
 * ESP32 Enterprise Signage Controller — Firmware v4.0.0-p1
 * ========================================================
 * Target : PCB V3, ESP32 + LAN8720 + MCP23017 (10 MOSFETs) + 4x ACS712
 * Pairs with : RaspberryPi/Gateway/Pi.py v2.0.0
 * Contract   : ESP32/esp32_contract.md
 *
 * PHASE 1 · PART 1 — HARDCODED BENCH BUILD, NO BATTERY.
 *   The purpose of this build is bring-up: get a handful of nodes onto Ethernet,
 *   connected to the Pi/broker, executing commands and streaming telemetry so
 *   they can be left running and observed. Everything is baked into source.
 *
 *   - ALL config is a compile-time const: per-unit IP + register, sensor
 *     calibration (ZERO/SENS), the PSU divider ratio, and every threshold.
 *     There is no runtime calibration and nothing is persisted — you edit the
 *     constants below and reflash.
 *   - The auto-calibration machinery (serial c/g/v/m/p) is GONE. Calibration
 *     returns in Phase 2, writing derived values to NVS instead of RAM.
 *   - Battery is GONE this build. No battery pin, no divider, no percentage,
 *     nothing published. Battery logic is Phase 1 · Part 2.
 *   - Serial menu is reduced to three commands: h (help), i (node info),
 *     s (sensor stream).
 *
 * CALIBRATION HONESTY: the SENS/ZERO/divider values below are datasheet-nominal
 * placeholders, NOT measured on this board. Ethernet, MQTT, command execution
 * and the animation are unaffected — but the 4-state current health is only
 * approximate until Phase-2 auto-calibration derives per-board values. Good
 * enough to verify connectivity and functionality; not yet a trustworthy alarm.
 *
 * WHAT CARRIED OVER FROM v3.0.0 (unchanged, deliberate — see esp32_contract.md §8):
 *   - I2C on 4/13 (GPIO17 is the LAN8720 50MHz clock).
 *   - 4 ACS712 channels: current1/2 = LHS/RHS arrows (switched), current3/4 =
 *     static zones 1/2 (hardwired always-on, monitored, never switched).
 *   - Modes 0-6 plus the 10000-11023 raw MOSFET bitmask. Mode 4 = solid LEFT,
 *     5 = solid RIGHT, 6 = solid ALL.
 *   - 'state' topic = what the node is ACTUALLY executing, published only after a
 *     verified MOSFET write. MCP unreachable => "FAULT" => gateway reads 65535.
 *   - Validated command parse (strtol, not atoi): a corrupt payload is rejected,
 *     never silently decoded as 0 = "arrows off".
 *   - Animation runs unconditionally: the sign keeps animating through a broker
 *     or link outage (hold-last-command). No NVS yet, so a reboot comes up dark
 *     until the retained 'value' topic re-commands it.
 *   - Network-first boot: an MCP/I2C fault never blocks the PHY, so the node
 *     still comes ONLINE and reports the fault as 'state' = 65535.
 *   - MOSFET writes are read back and verified; thresholds are set for BOTH
 *     sides on every mode change.
